/>重庆长生：欲望之城一整个冬季，我都渴望有一场雪，但是没有。于是，为了寻访六角形的花瓣，我辗转走过了几个北方城市。旅途中，火车每穿过一座城市，无论是疲倦的夜晚，还是在白天的刺眼的阳光下，我素来喜欢隔着车窗开外面是风景。火车停停靠靠，不管是那些车站，我总是乐此不疲的和看着陌生人的上车、安置行李、抢座、然后带着胜利者的笑容下车。在茫茫碌碌的身影里，我寻找漂泊的人影。就像我今天一样，我还在想着我下车后有没有这个城市的朋友来接我，或者我压根不想离开被我单薄的躯体暖热硬座。该下车了，广播里传出：“各位旅客，列车前方到站重庆车站，请下车的乘客收拾好行李物品，做好下车准备。”一路上我默然，下车也是。听着这熟悉的声音，我进入了涌动的人流。在重庆车站，我结束了南下的愿望。我想，我的爱情也会在我的生活里发生。我成都的朋友前不久还在电话里调皮的说，这里好好的，你为什么选择流浪呢？是呀，我现在被生活和爱情折磨成了神经病人。流浪也许是我这一生的生活方式。重庆的一月份，是一个阳光羞涩是季节。对于从北方来打工的弟弟一直对于阴沉多雾的天气这样抱怨着。就在这么一个季节的早晨,我把思维定格在一座城市的边缘。就这样，我在冰冷的空气中走过冬天，来到这片泥土芬芳的土地上。这里三面环山的土地，地势平坦，大气磅礴。一片都市边缘的土地，居然沾染着市民的气息。沿老路来这里，先前是一条穿越在山林间的乡村公路。途径南泉、鹿角、茶园到长生镇。这里的混居着不少外地人。大约在几个世纪前，这里大致是一偏荒凉的丘岭。在绿树环绕的村落周围，几间农家小院构筑了整个长生桥的风景。但我不知道。这次我没走20多分钟车程的高速路，但我寻访了一回生活的几年前长生人走过的路。长生是个小镇，在都市边缘。这是一个近年来成长起来的小镇，对于几十年后的我来说，是一个不能忘记的地方。过几天我就要离开这里了，也就是和这个城市再一次告别。长生的桥不少，面对陌生的桥，我不知道那一座是我要寻访的长生桥。我在街道边上问过几个年青人，对于我这样的问题大家只能摆手摇头。在一些人看来，我是一个神经病，在这里生活了大半年，居然问这么无聊的问题。多年来，我一直生活在社会的底层，直到我很偶然在一家刊物发表文字，上天给了我新的苦难。一个湖南的诗人朋友给我寄来一本他负责编辑的期刊，上面发表了我写的一首小诗歌。也是我“而立之年”命运在生活的夹缝中挣扎的见证。诗人在信中说：“诗歌是真实的美丽的，诗人是痛苦的悲壮的。”
透过表面看实质。不妨反射出生存中的咱们，咱们莫非不该当有这种不折不扣的坚忍实质?不该当有这种皑皑大雪也压不垮的精力?寒冬一过，白雪熔化，它仍旧青绿悠悠地挺着它那径直的身躯。雪熔化后那种比之前越发简单比之前越发高贵的品德。

/ > chongqing longevity: the city of desire throughout the winter, I are eager to have a snow, but no.
So, in order to search for hexagonal petals, I passed through several northern cities.
Journey, train across a city, whether it is tired of the night, or in the glare of the sun during the day, I like is the scenery outside through the window.
Train and man, whether the station, I always enjoyed and looked at the stranger get in the car, put the luggage, grab, and then get off with a winning smile.
In the figure of the vast mediocre, I looking for wandering figure.
Like me today, I was thinking I don't get off after the city's friends come to meet me, or I don't want to leave my thin body warm hot seat.
The out of the car, the radio spread: "chongqing, fellow travellers, in front of the station, the train station, please get off passengers packed my luggage, ready to get off."
But when I was all the way, get off, too.
Listen to the familiar voice, I entered the flowing stream of people.
The station in chongqing, I wish the south end.
I think, I love would happen in my life.
I in chengdu friends recently also naughty said on the phone, here good, why did you choose to stray?
Yes, I am tortured by life and love became nervous patient.
Stray maybe is my life's way of life.
Chongqing in January, is a sunshine shy is season.
To work from the north's younger brother was for heavy foggy weather with such complaints.
In such a season in the morning, I put my mind on the edge of a city.
So, I walked through the winter in the cold air, to the land of sweet earth.
Here surrounded on three sides by mountains of land surface, flat, majestic.
A city on the edge of the land, with a breath of the citizens.
Along the way to come here, which is a crossing in rural road between the mountains.
Way to southern spring, antlers, tea garden to the town of longevity.
The mixed with many people here.
About centuries ago, here is an desolate QiuLing roughly.
Around the village surrounded by green trees, among a few farm small courtyard constructs the immortality of the bridge landscape.
But I don't know.
This time I didn't walk twenty minutes' drive from the highway, but I searched for a time of life longevity in the way people walk a few years ago.
Immortality is a small town on the edge of the city.
This is a small town has grown up in recent years, for decades later I, is a place that can't forget.
I will leave here in a few days, that is, say goodbye to this city again.
Many immortal bridge, in the face of unfamiliar bridge, I don't know that one is I want to search for the longevity of the bridge.
I asked a few young people on the edge of the street, for me such a question can only be motioning with his hand shook his head.
For some, I am a mental derangement, living here for rectified, unexpectedly ask such a boring question.
Over the years, I have been living in the bottom of the society, until I am by chance in a journal published word, god gave me a new pain.
A hunan poet friend sent me a book he is responsible for the editing of journals, published a small poem I wrote.
I also "30" witnessing a fate in the cracks of life struggle.
Poet said in the letter: "poetry is real beauty, the poet is painful and tragic."
Through the surface.
Might as well reflected existence of we, we should not be this real perseverance substance?
Should not be the pristine snow pressure also is not breaking energy?
After the cold winter, snow melt, it is still green independently with its straight body.
After snow melt the than before more simple than before more noble moral character.
